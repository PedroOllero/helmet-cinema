A modern full stack web application for a movie theater, built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript on the frontend, and Node.js with Express on the backend.
Users can browse a catalog of movies, view detailed information, and more. The backend serves movie data via a REST API and is fully extensible for future features.
